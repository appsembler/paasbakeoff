Description: 
        Overview
        ========
        
        filebrowser_safe was created to provide a snapshot of the 
        `FileBrowser asset manager <http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/>`_ 
        for `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, to be referenced as a 
        dependency for the `Mezzanine CMS for Django <http://mezzanine.jupo.org/>`_.
        
        At the time of filebrowser_safe's creation, FileBrowser was incorrectly 
        packaged on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_, and had also dropped 
        compatibility with Django 1.1 - filebrowser_safe was therefore created to 
        address these specific issues.
        
        This repository exists for bug fixes and minor enhancements, and 
        should some day become redundant, once the original FileBrowser becomes 
        a feasibly stable dependency target.
